## Change++ Fall 2025 Coding Challenge

***Due 9/13 at 11:59 PM (CT)***

Please read this document **CAREFULLY** and to its **ENTIRETY**\!

**Before You Begin**  
The first step is completing the following coding project. 

* **Time Requirement:** \~5 hours (depending on experience level and technical skills).  
* **Note:** We will be having workshop(s) (structured presentations/tutorials) and office hours (unstructured help like TA hours) during the coding challenge. Join the Anchorlink and keep an eye out for an email\!

We recognize that you’re all busy, but as Change++ team member, it’s expected that you’ll dedicate 4-6 hours every week on your project.

**What We’re Looking For**  
At Change++, our teams include members from first-year undergraduates to graduate students with varying technical skills. We consider your experience when reviewing your code.

You’ll often work with new technologies not covered in Vanderbilt CS courses, so we value initiative and resourcefulness in learning and completing tasks efficiently.

We believe in you! You should be able to finish this challenge using basic programming knowledge (e.g., AP CS, CS-1101, CS-2201) combined with online resources.

Key qualities we seek in your code include:

**(1) Functionality**  
As always, the most important criteria is whether or not your code works according to the requirements. You should not only work to meet the requirements given, but also do your best to deliver a quality product, which may mean more than just completing the specification as stated.

**(2) Good style and Readability**  
As this is an untimed challenge, we expect a certain level of quality. Be sure to comment and format your code as you might while working on an application for one of our non-profits. Keep in mind we will be reading and trying to understand your code. It’s in your best interest to include intentional comments and meaningful commit messages.

**(3) Organization and Extensibility**  
This goes along with good style. We want to see your ability to develop maintainable code. Although we will not actually build further upon this challenge, you should organize your work in an intuitive manner which would make it easy to build upon in the future.

**(4) Creativity**  
Change++ members are people who use creativity and initiative to get things done. There will likely be plenty of applicants who attempt this challenge, so it will benefit you to make your program stand out.

**The Challenge**  
*From Helen Wu, 2025-2026 Change++ President*: Doomscrolling is fun. I feel like I don’t do enough of it. I can spend hours and hours on all of my social media apps. But I find myself still having time to do homework. This means I don’t have enough social media apps. I need ***more***.

Your goal is to build me a social media app so I can doomscroll more. I want to be able to make posts, like others’ posts and leave comments. Also make it look ***good**.*

You can take inspiration from existing social media applications such as: 

* Twitter  
* YouTube  
* Reddit  
* Instagram  
* Facebook  
* Spotify  
* etc…

You can even make your own original social media app\! **Note:** No option is necessarily better than the others.

## Deliverables 
**Frontend**  
The frontend serves as the way that a user would interact with your program and play the game. You have a lot of flexibility in terms of how you choose to build it ranging from a simple executable (ran from the terminal) to a website, app, or any (reasonable) technology you can think of. Feel free to get creative with styling components\!

**Backend**  
The backend consists of a RESTful API that can be accessed by the frontend and should do the following:

* Be a separate server from the frontend.  
* Endpoints to create posts, get posts, like/unlike posts and add/view comments.  
* Store posts in some sort of data structure. Bonus if you store it in a database\!

**README**  
Aside from adding, committing, and pushing your files to the repo, include a README.txt. INCLUDE YOUR FULL NAME AND VANDERBILT EMAIL IN THE README. A README is helpful because:

* We need information about how to download and run your program, especially if you are using an unconventional programming method. Please write down some instructions for us to follow to properly see your program.  
* We want you to include a brief (under 100 words) reflection about the challenge. Did you learn anything new? Reinforce any known concepts? Any issues come up?  
* We are interested in any feedback you provide about the coding challenge. If you have any critiques for us; workshops, office hours, or any part of the challenge itself, please let us know.

**Completion Form**

For your challenge to be considered complete, you must submit this short form:

2. **Office Hours:** September 10th, 5:00 PM in FGH 110 & September 11th, 6:00 PM in FGH 136

**If you have any general questions or want advice on how to get started/learn something, please email both Leo Zhang & Helen Wu at leo.t.zhang@vanderbilt.edu & helen.wu@vanderbilt.edu (in one email) **

<ul>
  <li>DO NOT TRY TO USE C++ FOR THIS PROJECT! We will be impressed if you manage to pull it off but it would also be really hard. Python or JavaScript are probably the easiest language to use to meet the base requirements and is not that hard to learn for someone who knows C++. Java is also doable, but might be slightly harder.</li>
  <li>We are trying to simulate "real world development" in this project so Google is definitely your friend. Be resourceful!! (Specifically, if you don't know where to start, you can google how to make an API in Python/JavaScript/etc)</li>
  <li>RESTful API
    <ul>
      <li>If you have never made an API before, it might seem fairly tricky. It is supposed to be a bit challenging, but definitely achievable and should not require a massive amount of code. There is a working solution of the backend written in less than 50 lines of code (note that it is totally ok if your solution is longer and a shorter solution is not necessarily a better solution, aim for clarity in your code).</li>
      <li>If you want to write an API, my first suggestion would be to google "how to write an API in {language of choice}". Follow a tutorial and copy paste some code and work with it until you generally understand what it is doing, then try to modify it to work for this project</li>
      <li>For a general explanation of what RESTful APIs are and how they work, check out this link: https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/RESTful-API</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Git
    <ul>
      <li>If you have never used git before it might seem a little daunting but it is actually, for this project at least, fairly straightforward. If you have any specific issues with it, try google and if you still can't figure it out, email leo.t.zhang@vanderbilt.edu for help</li>
      <li>If you want a basic tutorial on Git, check out this link: https://hackernoon.com/understanding-git-fcffd87c15a3</li>
      <li>To get you on the right track, the only commands you should need to use for this are `git clone {repo}`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, and `git push`</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Good luck! We believe in you, and are excited to see what you create!</li>
</ul>
